Mental Ray standalone issues:

- Three environment variables PATH, SI_LINKTAB_LOCATION and
  SPM_HOST should be set appropriately in mentalray_sg.py or
  in the shell before running the DrQueue slave
- When submitting a mental ray job using drqman, the "Maximum
  number of cpus on one computer" should better be set to '1'.
  Since each instance exhausts a dedicated license without any
  gain in performance.
