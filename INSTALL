Building the software
=====================

DrQueue uses scons for building (and later on installing)

To build the main DrQueue command line tools and the Gtk+ 
GUI drqman just type:

$ scons

Installing the binaries
=======================

For example:

$ scons PREFIX=/usr/local install

will install the drqueue tree into '/usr/local/drqueue'

You may also modify the file 'scons.conf' to change the
default values.

To clean the installed files:

$ scons install -c

Python
======

The python module uses setuptools. The generic approach for
it whould be:

$ cd python
$ sudo python setup.py install

You'll need root privileges to do a system-wide installation
