  return int. And error checking should be coded 
  extensively.

* Renice options
* STEPFRAME included in all .sg files
* Autoenable flag. For 0.52
* Computer limits renderer. 0.52

NOTES:
-----

* I should use a dynamically allocated structure for the computers' tasks (or not?)
* Both the frame index and the frame number are uint32 so no negative numbers are supported.
* Job logs are removed when the job is deleted by user request, if the job is deleted because of a failure
  they are not removed.

DRQMAN
------

* Put a button to change the mail notification stuff
* Autorefresh configurable
* Watching the output logs as tail -f does.
* Names of computers instead of id numbers.
