TO DO:
-----

* If any directory does not exist at the beginning create them if there is an apropiate flag
* Authentication on the slave requests.
* job permissions.
* functions that return void in communications should
  return int. And error checking should be coded 
  extensively.
* There are no consistency checks in the slave. Should be.
* License control
* User defined shell for script generators
* Renice options
* STEPFRAME included in all .sg files
* Put together both sendjobs and add a -t type flag for the different
  renderers

BUGS:

NOTES:
-----

* I should use a dynamically allocated structure for the computers' tasks (or not?)
* Both the frame index and the frame number are uint32 so no negative numbers are supported.
* Job logs are removed when the job is deleted by user request, if the job is deleted because of a failure
  they are not removed.

DRQMAN
------

* Put a button to change the mail notification stuff
* Autorefresh configurable
* Watching the output logs as tail -f does.
* Names of computers instead of id numbers.

BUGS:
----

* In the new job dialog I cannot justify the labels to the left
* When I delete a job from the detailed job information dialog the windows isn't closed after.
* You need to hit refresh after a hard stop.
