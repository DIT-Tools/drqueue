
BOOTSTRAP
---------

If you got the sources from the repository you'll need to bootstrap autotools.

bash$ ./bootstrap

That should create a configure script, besides all other related files.

CONFIGURE
---------

bash$ ./configure

To create the Makefiles and configuration headers.

bash$ make

To compile into binaries: slave,master,drqman and libdrqueue.

GTK and pkg-config
------------------

To use the native windows gtk+ libraries you'll need to 
point PKG_CONFIG_PATH to the right windows style path 
(like "C:\GTK\lib\pkgconfig").

.install drqueue and run drqueue-services

to compil drqueue under windows you need do all this steps
----------------------------------------------------------

.download cygwin from
http://www.cygwin.com/setup.exe

.run cygwin setup and choose install for devel category (click on devel)
and tcsh (used by drqueue) 

.please use tortoise svn to extract drqueue sources as cygwin svn as some problems.

.run again cygwin setup with default settings to be sure verything is installed

.get win32 gtk development environment at 
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/gladewin32/gtk-win32-devel-2.6.7-rc1.exe
Install it in c:\cygwin\usr\local\gtk (uncheck register environment..)

.Add /usr/local/gtk/bin to PATH environment variable in cygwin with command 
export PATH=/usr/local/gtk/bin:$PATH

http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=9B3A2CA6-3647-4070-9F41-A333C6B9181D&displaylang=en
it will be needed to run (and to compil) windows drqueue services 

.type "make DOTNETPATH=c:/windows/microsoft.net/framework/you_version install"
replace your_version with the actual dotnet framework version (v1.1.4322
for exemple)

.you get drqueue-setup.exe (in /usr/local/drqueue/contrib/ by default)
which contains everything needed, just install it as any windows 
application
