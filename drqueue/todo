* Frame_info memory allocation and deallocation		[DONE]
* Priority support for jobs				[DONE]
* Check frames registered as running if running really	[DONE]
* Process output logging				[DONE]

* The slave must check that the requests come from the
  master
* job permissions.
* flag on master and slave to set logging level.	[DONE]
* logging on screen					[DONE]
* functions that return void in communications should
  return int. And error checking should be coded 
  extensively.
* file locking on logging functions
* check file descriptor numbers on connect to see if
  they grow.

BUGS:
----


NOTES:
-----

* The frame number in the task struct is _different_ from iframe in the job handling stuff
* I should use a dynamically allocated structure for the computers' tasks (or not?)
* Both the index frame and the frame number are uint32 so no negative numbers supported.

DRQMAN
------

* Update button in the detailed job information dialog.

BUGS:
----

* In the new job dialog I cannot justify the labels to the left
* When there is no job selected and you click on remove it removes row 0		[SOLVED]
