TO DO:
-----

* Remove logs when the job is removed from the queue
* Summary of transmissions (Kb/s sent, Kb/s received)
* Checks at the beginning of every program for the directories.
* limit structures for jobs.
* Master database saved and reloaded from disk.
* The slave must check that the requests come from the
  master.
* job permissions.
* functions that return void in communications should
  return int. And error checking should be coded 
  extensively.
* file locking on logging functions.
* check file descriptor numbers on connect to see if
  they grow.
* Silent logging, no output at all.
* Mail notifications
* On the registration if the computer ip can not be resolved
  then use the string of the ip address as name.

BUGS:
----

* When I set a frame as waiting it must check before if it is finished.

NOTES:
-----

* I should use a dynamically allocated structure for the computers' tasks (or not?)
* Both the frame index and the frame number are uint32 so no negative numbers are supported.

DRQMAN
------

* Autorefresh configurable
* Watching the output logs as tail -f does.
* Names of computers instead of id numbers.

BUGS:
----

* In the new job dialog I cannot justify the labels to the left
* When I delete a job from the detailed job information dialog the windows isn't closed after.
* You need to hit refresh after a hard stop.

INSTALLATION NOTES:
------------------

1) Check that the master host resolves to the same point on both directions.
2) The creation of the logs directory is not automatic
3) Binaries on DRQUEUE_ROOT/bin
4) DRQUEUE_ROOT/tmp directory
