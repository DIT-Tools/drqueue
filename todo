TO DO:
-----

* Frame_info memory allocation and deallocation		[DONE]
* Priority support for jobs				[DONE]
* Check frames registered as running if running really	[DONE]
* Process output logging				[DONE]
* file locking on logging functions
* limit structures for jobs and computers
* Negative and backwards frame numbers
* Master database saved and reloaded from disk
* Update the r_r_taskfini protocol
* -f to force if shared memory or semaphores exist	[DONE]
* The slave must check that the requests come from the
  master


BUGS:
----

* If there is no task space available on a computer the frame is still assigned.
  This happens ONLY if there are more processors than MAXTASKS, so the computer
  is still available even with all the tasks filled.

NOTES:
-----

* The frame number in the task struct is _different_ from iframe in the job handling stuff
* I should use a dynamically allocated structure for the computers' tasks
