TO DO:
-----

* If any directory does not exist at the beginning create them if there is an apropiate flag
* configurable script generator
* The slave must check that the requests come from the
  master.
* job permissions.
* functions that return void in communications should
  return int. And error checking should be coded 
  extensively.
* On the registration if the computer ip can not be resolved
  then use the string of the ip address as name.
* There are no consistency checks in the slave. Should be.
* License control

BUGS:
----

NOTES:
-----

* I should use a dynamically allocated structure for the computers' tasks (or not?)
* Both the frame index and the frame number are uint32 so no negative numbers are supported.
* Job logs are removed when the job is deleted by user request, if the job is deleted because of a failure
  they are not removed.

DRQMAN
------

* Put a button to change the mail notification stuff
* Autorefresh configurable
* Watching the output logs as tail -f does.
* Names of computers instead of id numbers.

BUGS:
----

* In the new job dialog I cannot justify the labels to the left
* When I delete a job from the detailed job information dialog the windows isn't closed after.
* You need to hit refresh after a hard stop.

INSTALLATION NOTES:
------------------

1) Check that the master host resolves to the same point on both directions.
2) The creation of the logs directory is not automatic
3) Binaries on DRQUEUE_ROOT/bin
4) DRQUEUE_ROOT/tmp directory
