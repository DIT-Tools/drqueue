TO DO:
-----

* Checks at the beginning of every program for the 
  environment variables and directories.
* Names of computers instead of id numbers.
* limit structures for jobs and computers.
* Master database saved and reloaded from disk.
* The slave must check that the requests come from the
  master.
* job permissions.
* functions that return void in communications should
  return int. And error checking should be coded 
  extensively.
* file locking on logging functions.
* check file descriptor numbers on connect to see if
  they grow.
* Silent logging, no output at all.


BUGS:
----


NOTES:
-----

* The frame number in the task struct is _different_ from iframe in the job handling stuff
* I should use a dynamically allocated structure for the computers' tasks (or not?)
* Both the index frame and the frame number are uint32 so no negative numbers are supported.

DRQMAN
------

* Update button in the detailed job information dialog.

BUGS:
----

* In the new job dialog I cannot justify the labels to the left
