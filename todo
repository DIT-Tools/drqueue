TO DO:
-----

* Frame_info memory allocation and deallocation		[DONE]
* file locking on logging functions
* limit structures for jobs and computers
* Negative and backwards frame numbers
* Master database saved and reloaded from disk

BUGS:
----

* If there is no task space available on a computer the frame is still assigned.
  This happens ONLY if there are more processors than MAXTASKS, so the computer
  is still available even with all the tasks filled.
