Ruby/Python is a Ruby extension library to use Python modules
from Ruby scripts.

* Installation

Requirements:

  - ruby-1.4.x or ruby-1.6.x
  - python-1.5.x

Compile:

  ruby extconf.rb [options]
  make
  make install

You can specify options when you run 'ruby extconf.rb':

`--with-python-dir=PREFIX'
    Prefix where Python is installed.  If this option omitted, prefix
    is derived by executing `python'.  If this also fails, search for
    `/usr/local' and `/usr' in this order.

* Usage

See the documentation under directory "doc".  Directory "examples"
contains some example scripts.
